================

I'm using [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) for managing this blog. Github Pages is one of the lesser knowm features of Github which lets you create pages for a project or a user. The pages are static and is stored in a repository just like everything else on Github. What makes it a great candidate for a blog is that it supports [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) by [AUTHOR](http://tom.preston-werner.com/).

Taken from it's docs Jekyll at its core is a text transformation engine. You write static files which Jekyll transforms into a nice looking webpage by using some layout files which is also created by you. For a nice guide on how to use Jekyll and Github Pages you can read EnvyLabs has written a nice article about how to [publish a blog on Github Pages](http://blog.envylabs.com/2009/08/publishing-a-blog-with-github-pages-and-jekyll/) using Jekyll.
