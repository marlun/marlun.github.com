================

I'm using Github Pages for managing this blog. Github Pages is one of the lesser knowm features of Github which lets you create pages for a project or a user. The pages are static and is stored in a repository just like everything else on Github. What makes it a great candidate for a blog is that it supports [Jekyll](http://) by [AUTHOR](http://).

Taken from it's docs Jekyll at its core is a text transformation engine. You write static files which Jekyll transforms into a nice looking webpage by using some layout files which is also created by you. For a nice guide on how to use Jekyll and Github Pages you can read WEBSITES nice article.
